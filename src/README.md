# VGA-controller-mimas
VGA controller for mimas development board

This is work in progress.

I had not used verilog in a while and after receiving my mimas
development board,
http://numato.com/mimas-v2-spartan-6-fpga-development-board-with-ddr-sdram.html,
 I started to refresh my memory by writing some verilog code.

I also bought the AD9283 ADC Expansion Module, http://numato.com/ad9283-adc-expansion-module.html?___store=woen,
 so my first attemped is to write a little data capture program and
display the data on an VGA monitor.
